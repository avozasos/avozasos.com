When songs and images commune births - are there video-songs? <br><br>
When the sense of what is said is not just sound<br> - are there video-songs?<br><br>
When sound is felt through the movement of bodies<br> - are there video-songs?<br><br>
When lips whisper the unheard - is there song? <br><br>
When an image is followed by another - is there melody?<br><br>
The voice, alone - a series of 9 video-songs.
